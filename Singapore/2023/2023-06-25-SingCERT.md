Dear GitHub team,

 

Greetings from SingCERT the National CERT of Singapore!

 

We would like to bring your attention to an Android malware builder, whose source code is hosted and available on your platform (https[:]//github[.]com/EVLF/Cypher-Rat-Source-Code).

 

The source code could be used to produce malware (malicious apps) to commit cybercrime. SingCERT and the Singapore Police Force has received multiple reports from scam victims who have had their devices compromised possibly by Android malware. From our analysis of the .apk malware samples retrieved, there appears to be a strong correlation to the source code mentioned above.

 

We strongly recommend that your organisation investigate the source code hosted on your platform and take down the resource as soon as possible to prevent further downloads. We would appreciate if you could acknowledge this email.

 

We have assigned an incident reference number (SingCERT_20230626-C271158) to this report. Please include it in the subject line for future correspondences relating to this report.

 

Regards,

SingCERT
